# Monty Hall Paradox

### About paradox
*A guest on the show has to choose among three doors, behind one of which is a prize. The guest states his choice, and the host opens one of the two remaining closed doors, always being careful that it is one behind which there is no prize. Should the guest switch to the remaining closed door? Most people choose to stay with their original choice, which is wrongâ€”switching would increase their chance of winning from 1/3 to 2/3. (There is a 1/3 chance that the guest's original pick was correct, and that does not change.)*
